            Freddie Mercury was a famous singer, songwriter, and music
            composer in the 70's & the 80's. He was born Farrokh Bulsara on
            September 5, 1946, in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Mercury was born with four
            extra teeth in the back of his mouth, causing his now-famous bucktooth
            grin. In fact, his nickname growing up was Bucky. Mercury was open
            about his bisexuality, but he kept his relationships private. He spent
            time in a boarding school in  Mumbai, India, where he studied Piano.
            After that Freddie moved to London with his family and he attended
            Ealing College of Art and he befriended with a lot of musicians
            around this time including Queen bandmates, drummer Roger Taylor and
            guitarist Brian May.
